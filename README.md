The Thousand Stars.

The first five thousands brightest stars in the entire night sky in nice 3d viewer, down to magnitude 5.99. Made with React, with some nice CSS animations here and there.

To-do:

1. Add planets
2. nebulas
3. The ability to rotate the star map to reflect locations on Earth
4. Some kind of abstraction layer holding the html events (mouse clicks, touches) and retaining state across canvas re-renders (highest priority)
